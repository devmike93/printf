## 0x11. C - printf

A collaboration project involving almost everything we have learnt in c so far.

**Description**

This team project is part of the first year curriculum of ALX. _printf replicates the C standard library printf() function.

What you should learn from this project:

How to use git in a team setting
Applying variadic functions to a big project
The complexities of printf
Managing a lot of files and finding a good workflow

**Tasks**

0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life: A function that produces output according to a format.

1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't.: Handling conversion specifiers (d, i)

2. With a face like mine, I do better in print: Handling custom conversion specifiers (b)

3. What one has not experienced, one will never understand in print.: More conversion specifiers (u, o, x, X)

4. Nothing in fine print is ever good news.: Using a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible

5. My weakness is wearing too much leopard print: Handling the S custom conversion specifier

6. How is the world ruled and led to war? Diplomats lie to journalists and believe these lies when they see them in print: Handling the p conversion specifier

7. The big print gives and the small print takes away: Handling flag characters (+, space, #)

8. Sarcasm is lost in print: Handling length modifiers (l, h)

9. Print some money and give it to us for the rain forests: Handling the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.

10. The negative is the equivalent of the composer's score, and the print the performance: Handling the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.

11. It's depressing when you're still around and your albums are out of print: Handling the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

12. Every time that I wanted to give up, if I saw an interesting textile, print what ever, suddenly I would see a collection: Handling the - flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

13. Print is the sharpest and the strongest weapon of our party: Handling the r custom conversion specifier.

14. The flood of print has turned reading into a process of gulping rather than savoring: Handling the R custom conversion specifier.

15. *: Checking all the functions are working well
